# Inspire Mini Game

*A Proof of Concept Micogame for the Arcade Cabinet* *

### Disclaimer

The following game currently uses online art and does not include the animations we intend to use in the final microgame sequences.

### Demo

Download it for [Mac](Exports/mac.app), [Linux](Exports/linux.x86), or [Windows](Exports/windwos.exe)

If you encounter problems (I only tested for mac right now), feel free to check out the [Exports]() Folder to see if you are missing the _data file.
### Gameplay

![Image of Gameplay](images/gameplay.png)

Gameplay works like this:

The Player is told, using @stevenyacoub's transition, "FIND THE THINKER"

The Player is to wait until a lightbulb goes on someone's head — this will happen anywhere between 3 and 5 seconds — (if they act before this, they lose for rushing the thinkers)

Once a lightbulb goes on, the Player has 5 seconds to press the action key in order to win.

### Max Gameplay Time

10 seconds + transition time

### Problems

- Not pretty
- Not using our art
- Lacking Transitions
